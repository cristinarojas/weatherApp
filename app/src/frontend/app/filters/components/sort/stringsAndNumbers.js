  title: "Pennsylvania Special Election",
  summary: "Republican state Rep. Rick Saccone has benefitted from high-level help: President Donald Trump visited the district, and Vice President Mike Pence railed against Democrat Conor Lamb on a recent trip to campaign with Saccone. This suburban Pittsburgh district heavily favored Trump in 2016 â€“ but after a series of GOP losses in recent months, outside Republican groups spent millions on ads to bolster his chances, linking Lamb to House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi.",
